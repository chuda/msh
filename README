msh (MailShell) - is simple remote shell with communications via emails.

The algo is simple:
  1. Get commands from email
  2. Run commands
  3. Send back results

It's quite secure, by using 3 filtering levels:
  - filtering by mail's subject
  - filtering mail from users through white and black lists
  - authorisation by user+password
